# Recipe-Recommendation-System
This project presents a hybrid recommendation
system that integrates collaborative filtering and content-based
filtering for recipe recommendations. Collaborative filtering
employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix
factorization, capturing user preferences. Simultaneously,
content-based filtering utilizes TF-IDF vectorization on recipe
attributes to enhance item characterization. Through
meticulous preprocessing and transformation steps, the model
demonstrates improved accuracy and diversity, validated using
metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). A personalized
recommendation approach, blending collaborative and
contentbased aspects, further refines user-specific suggestions,
offering a promising solution for enhanced recipe discovery.
